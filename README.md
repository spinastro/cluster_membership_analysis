# Cluster Membership Analysis
Stellar clusters are groups of stars formed together, at the same time, and from the same material. Stars that are members of the same cluster share a similar spatial location and kinematics compared to all the other stars. I used billions of data provided by the Gaia spacecraft to model the distribution of stars in the sky and assign to each of them a bayesian probability of being part of a cluster.

This code uses Machine Learning algorithms to identify members of stellar clusters
